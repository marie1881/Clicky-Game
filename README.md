# The Simpsons Clicky Game
***
This is a react based web application that allows you to guess a random character from The Simpsons.  Once you select the character, the position of all the other Simpsons characters will randomly change position.  The goal of the game is to get all 12 Simpsons Characters guessed without selecting the same character twice!

### Motivation

The goal was to showcase my skills in react by building a basic react app that has multiple components and props. 

### UI/UX

The design of the application uses Bootstrap 4 as a framework.  It is intentionally designed to be responsive to your device.  The colors used give the user a welcoming feeling with less strain on the eyes. 

### Technologies Used
